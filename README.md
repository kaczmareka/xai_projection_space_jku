# Explainable AI Assignment 1: Projection Space Exploration
In this assignment, you are challenged to analyze and compare solutions of a problem, game, algorithm, model, or anything else that can be represented by sequential states. For this, you will project the high-dimensional states to the two-dimensional space, connect the states, and add meta-data to the visualization.

Exemplary solutions are provided in the `solution_rubik.ipynb` and `solution_2048.ipynb` notebooks.

Further examples to analyze are (board) games and approximation algorithms. The 2048 notebook uses [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) to create a game environment and produce state data. There is a variety of first and third party environments for Gym that can be used.

### Dataset
Please add your dataset to the repository (or provide a link if it is too large) and answer the following questions about it:

* Which dataset are you using? What is it about?<br>
    We decided to use a dataset containing many games of the board game Othello. You can try it out at: https://www.eothello.com/

* Where did you get this dataset from (i.e., source of the dataset)? How was the dataset generated?<br>
  We got the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/andrefpoliveira/othello-games), from the user Andr√© Oliveria. The dataset was generated by recording each move in the game. It contains games played by the TOP 100 players on eOthello. 

* What is dataset size in terms of nodes, items, rows, columns, ...?<br>
  The dataset contains 25 658 rows where each row represents one game of Othello. The dataset has 3 columns, eOthello_game_id, winner and game_moves. In the column winner, 1 stands for win for blacks, -1 for whites, and 0 for a draw. The column game_moves contains sequences of game moves. To be able to use this dataset, we will have to translate the moves into game states.

* What do you want to analyze?<br>
  We would like to find out patterns which may indicate various game strategies. Furthermore, we would like to see which game states tend to lead to certain defeat.

* What are you expecting to see?<br>
  As mentioned in the previous paragraph, we expect to see patterns which may indicate various game strategies.


## Final Submission due on 10.11.2021, 23:59

* Make sure that you pushed your GitHub repository and not just committed it locally.
* Sending us an email with the code is not necessary.
* Update the *environment.yml* file if you need additional libraries, otherwise the code is not executeable.
* Create a single notebook with your solution, e.g. solution.ipynb.
* Save your final executed notebook as html (File > Download as > HTML) and add them to your repository.


## Development Environment

Checkout this repo and change into the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/jku-icg-classroom/xai_proj_space_2021-<GROUP_NAME>.git
cd xai_proj_space_2021-<GROUP_NAME>
```

Load the conda environment from the shared `environment.yml` file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate xai_proj_space
```

> Hint: For more information on Anaconda and enviroments take a look at the README in our [tutorial repository](https://github.com/JKU-ICG/python-visualization-tutorial).

Then launch Jupyter Lab:
```
jupyter lab
```

Go to http://localhost:8888/ and open the *template* notebook.

Alternatively, you can also work with [binder](https://mybinder.org/), [deepnote](https://deepnote.com/), [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), or any other service as long as the notebook runs in the standard Jupyter environment.
